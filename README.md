# SemiRALD: A Semi-supervised Hybrid Language Model for Robust Anomalous Log Detection

This paper proposes SemiRALD, a Semi-supervised learning-based Robust ALD approach. SemiRALD utilizes ChatGPT and in-context learning for automated log parsing, thereby improving the log integrity during log parsing. Subsequently, it harnesses a semi-supervised learning framework and our proposed hybrid language model to remedy the performance degeneration caused by low-resource restriction in practice.
